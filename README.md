# NestJS Wikipedia API Proxy

This project is a **NestJS** API that serves as a proxy for the **Wikipedia Featured Content API** and includes translation functionality using the **LibreTranslate API**. The API fetches featured content from Wikipedia for a specific date and allows translation of content into different languages.

## Project Overview

This project contains two main functionalities:
1. **Wikipedia Featured Content Proxy**: Fetches featured content from the Wikipedia API based on a date.
2. **Translation of Featured Content**: Uses the LibreTranslate API to translate the fetched Wikipedia content into a specified language.

### Endpoints:

- **GET `/feed`**: Fetch featured content for a given date and language.
- **GET `/feed/translate/:language`**: Fetch and translate featured content for a given date into the specified language.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the Wikipedia and LibreTranslate APIs.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and better developer experience.
- **Jest**: For unit testing.

## Prerequisites
docker pull libretranslate/libretranslate
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **LibreTranslate API**: You can either use a self-hosted LibreTranslate instance or an external service.
## API Endpoints

The backend service acts as a proxy for Wikipedia's Featured Content API and offers translation functionality using the LibreTranslate API.

### Get Featured Content

Fetches featured content from Wikipedia for a specific date and language.

- **URL**: `/feed`

#### Example Request

```bash
"/feed?date=2024/09/10&language=en"
```
